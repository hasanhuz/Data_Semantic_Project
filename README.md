# Data_Semantic_Project at IUB
There has been an upsurge in efforts, in recent
times, to align healthcare with semantic web.
Proponents of healthcare and biomedical research
are starting to acknowledge the benefits of sharing
data across different domains and are finding ways
to reap the benefits of semantic web. This paper
highlights the work done in order to create
MedSearch, a semantic search system that uses
Jena Reasoner and SPARQL to display list of
symptoms and treatment available for the list of
diseases available in the dataset. We describe the
process of (1) creating our own dataset with list of
diseases, its symptoms and treatment (2) building
the OWL/RDF ontology using Protégé (3) building
a Jena Reasoner and use SPARQL query to display
results and finally (4) use Parametrized query to
display results based on user input.
